#Mimetic

Mimetic considers a single width structure e.g,'1024' and scales the design to any screen size with minimal/ optional refinements necessary.

Mimetic can work with any framework that can detatch from its grid system. Eg., Bootstrap, Foundation, etc.
This current alpha release dosen't include Mimetic.stack, a feature to stack content for mobile devices.

##Install

Embed Mimetic directly into the page via < script > tags for seamless results, this is the recommended way.
Place the script just before the </ body > tag.

##Dependencies

No dependencies, but to suport IE8 and below use <b>html5shiv</b> in the head.
